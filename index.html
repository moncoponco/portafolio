          <p class="body-text">November 2024- April 2025 (5 months)</p>
          <p class="body-text">Consulted with the US expansion team at Knowunity (EdTech, 9M users) to address creator retention and engagement by elevating the status of top content creators ("Lighthouse Knowers"). I designed and executed, along with two more researchers and a product manager, a multi-segmented evaluative study (interviews and usability testing) to assess barriers to growth. A key finding revealed that creators rejected the client's "influencer" model, prioritizing an authentic, Discord-like community over follower counts. This insight drove 7+ strategic recommendations—focused on discovery pathways, subject-based content linkage, and group chat functionality.</p>

          <p class="body-text">Drove the product vision and artist acquisition strategy for MUSA, a platform that bypassed traditional galleries by connecting emerging artists directly with local venues for exhibitions and pop-up events. I led the development and refinement of two MVP iterations: a V1 on CRM and a V2 with development contractors. Our focus was on solving artist pain points through features like a simplified application flow, tag solution and payment. Over two years during the Covid pandemic, I scaled the community to 250+ Bay Area artists and 20 venues, facilitating over 200 successful events and fostering local artistic exposure, while adapting our offerings to follow the guidelines of early and late lockdown.</p>

          Strongly yin and yang, my journey here hopscotched between different analytic and creative disciplines... I began studying Medicine at the University of Buenos Aires, then graduated with honors from UC Berkeley in 2021 with a B.A. in History of Art, focusing on neuroaesthetics which stufies how the brain responds to visual experience. Along the way, I helped build a digital platform for Bay Area artists, which sparked my interest in technology and product building. That journey took me  eventually to New York City, where I earned a Master’s in Information Experience Design at Pratt Institute.
